Welcome to the SelfhostedPro blog. I'm going to be sharing various things from how I setup my homelab to setting up automation for docker images and DigitalOcean marketplace images.

I'm a DevOps engineer out of San Diego California. If you have any questions or want to chat, feel free to hop into my discord server using the link in the bar on the left.
